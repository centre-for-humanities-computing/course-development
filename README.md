# Coding in Humanities - Course Development

This repository is a collection of ideas and an initial framework for teaching coding techniques to Humanities students. The main purpose is to be able to identify tasks that can be automated, break down those tasks into smaller ones, and solve them using programming techniques. The information proposed here is largely a guideline on how to approach these problems and set up a working plan of action to solve them. It is therefore irrelevant which programming language is used, the concepts are universal.

# Course Modules
## Technical
## 1. Basics - from the real world to the digital world

When a person thinks about what programming is, they often think about writing strange characters onto a black screen and seeing a waterfall of green coding snippets fill the screen - like in the movie "The Matrix". Quite disappointingly, this isn't what programming is. Programming, in a nutshell, is solving a problem then converting that solution into something a machine (computer) can understand. In fact we do programming every day, we just don't realize it. The purpose of these five modules is to provide you with the tools to convert real-world problems into computational problems then solve them using a programming language. You might be curious to know where you have been using programming in your daily life, so below is an example of that.

Imagine it's a Monday morning and you have a class starting at 09:00 at the university. You arrive at the university at 08:45 - in time to grab a cup of coffee. There are two coffee shops on campus (Coffee Shop A and Coffee Shop B) - you prefer Coffee Shop A, but the lines are usually quite long. So you tell yourself, if there are 4 or fewer people in the line at Coffee Shop A then you'll wait in line, but if there are more then you will go to Coffee Shop B. Congratulations, you've just done some programming!

## 2. Control Flow

When programming, the computer will follow your instructions 100% literally. This means that it's not uncommon for a single semi-colon or a capital letter to break the flow of a program. It is important to imagine how a computer would process the instructions you are giving it. In this way you can find errors easier and be able to fix them

## Practical
## 3. Identifying real-world problems
**IPO tables:** 
1. **Input** - establish thinking around data types
	-	Practical: determine what your input is and what data type it is.
2.  **Processing** - establish thinking around what you expect the program to do
	-	Practical: determine what you want to do with your input.
3.  **Output** - establish thinking about what you expect to get out
	-	Practical: determine how you want you input to be at the end of the process.

**Finding answers to questions**

In most cases, the answers you find to questions you are searching for will be sufficient, but not exact. Finding answers is about finding something that works similar to what you are building, then tweaking it to fit your use case. 
## 4. Finding solutions - turning pseudocode into runnable code
**Examples**
1. I am an historian and I need to go through 3000 documents to find specific people and list the sentences their names appear in. I can then read through those sentences manually to find which ones are relevant to my research.
	-  Input
	    -  	Find the data i.e. where is it located? Can you access it?
	    -   In which format is the data i.e. text files, pdfs, physical books?
    -   Processing
	    -   Read the files
	    -   Split the files into sentences
	    -   Loop through each sentence and save those which have the name to a list
    - Output
	    - Save those lists to a file which can be read or printed out
  2. Iâ€™m a linguist and I need to extract all the verbs from a document, count them and display the top 10 occurring verbs. I will use these top 10 verbs to determine what the document is about.
		- Input
			-    Find the document i.e. where is located?
			-   Determine what file type the document is.
		- Processing
			-   Read the contents of the document
			-   Separate all the words
			-   Filter out anything that is not a verb
			-   Count the remaining verbs
			-   Sort them from most frequency to least frequent
		- Output
			- Display the top 10 elements of the sorted list
## 5. OOP Defensive programming/testing
