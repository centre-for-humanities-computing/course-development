## 1. Basics - from the real world to the digital world
### Introduction
This module has been designed to help you understand the basic idea behind 'computational thinking' i.e. thinking in a way that helps to logically solve problems. This type of thinking is fundamental to being able to write code and solve computational problems. This course is mainly about problem solving because essentially what programmers do is they solve problems. Writing code is just a structured way to get the computer to understand what you want it to do. The great thing about this is that it means you can apply what you learn here to your daily life - not just programming. 
> Computational thinking is the thought processes involved in formulating a problem and expressing its solution(s) in such a way that a computer - human or machine - can effectively carry out. 03:54 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9Xy18YEK9M)

Everyone is - at least at the end of your educational program - going to have to solve a novel problem. I am of course referring to writing your thesis which will deal with a topic that is not yet solved. You need to have a clear way of thinking to solve that problem, even if your thesis doesn't have anything to do with programming. 

### How do we solve problems in our everyday life?
Problem solving is happening in our brains every second of every day, but most of it happens so quickly and smoothly that we don't notice it. We also have the added benefit that in our local environment, there are many assumptions we make because the more time we spend in an environment, the more efficient our behavior becomes. For example, suppose you are talking to a friend with whom you grew up in the same town. Both of you know the layout of that town quite well because you grew up there. So if you were giving your friend directions in that town, you could say "turn left by that old house on the corner". Your friend would understand the reference because they have prior knowledge of what you are talking about. However, if you were explaining the same directions to someone from out of town, they wouldn't necessary know what you're talking about.

You might be wondering, how does this relate to problem solving? The process of problem solving means breaking a problem into smaller steps - this is known as decomposition. Before you can do that, you need to understand that your brain has made your thinking process as efficient as possible by eliminating redundancy i.e. your friend already knows where the old house is, so why would you explain it again?

### Making decisions 
The data for any given decision is infinite so you can't take all variables into account - even theoretically - as is explained by Alan Watts in [the Potato farmer story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCyloOL2DY). For this reason it always seems so overwhelming when dealing with real world problems because real world problems don't come with instructions on how to solve them or a list of variables that are relevant. Figuring out those things are some of the most difficult steps. But just like in the Potato farmer story, if you overwhelm yourself with decisions then you won't be able to cope with the realities of life.

### Templates as a concept of problem solving
Solving a problem in the context of a course exercise does not provide any concrete solutions to real world problems because the problem has already been solved - by the authors of the course and/or the teacher running the lecture. So, what's the point of doing it? Solving the problem creates a template in your mind. This template can be used to solve other problems that are similar or the template can serve a baseline which can be customized to the new problem. This is a process called "pattern recognition".

When a person thinks about what programming is, they often think about writing strange characters onto a black screen and seeing a waterfall of green coding snippets fill the screen - like in the movie "The Matrix". Quite disappointingly, this isn't what programming is. Programming, in a nutshell, is solving a problem then converting that solution into something a machine (computer) can understand. In fact we do programming every day, we just don't realize it. The purpose of these five modules is to provide you with the tools to convert real-world problems into computational problems then solve them using a programming language. You might be curious to know where you have been using programming in your daily life, so below is an example of that.

Imagine it's a Monday morning and you have a class starting at 09:00 at the university. You arrive at the university at 08:45 - in time to grab a cup of coffee. There are two coffee shops on campus (Coffee Shop A and Coffee Shop B) - you prefer Coffee Shop A, but the lines are usually quite long. So you tell yourself, if there are 4 or fewer people in the line at Coffee Shop A then you'll wait in line, but if there are more then you will go to Coffee Shop B. This is a very simple example of a if-statement in programming, so congratulations, you've just done some programming!

### Thinking independently
There is no "know-all" guide to programming because each problem has a unique set of difficulties. If this weren't the case then you could just use a program someone else has already written. In many cases, you will use parts of other people's code, but the changes you make are unique to the use case you have. So, one of the most important aspects of programming is to be able to work independently and collaboratively. The independent aspect is mostly centered around being able to visualize what your solution is going to be. You need to understand the problem, develop a plan to solve it, and be able to communicate this to other people. In order to do this, you have to learn to develop an independent way of thinking.  

This may seem counterintuitive, so here is a practical example. Imagine that you have a real-world problem, but you cannot ask any one person for help until you have your own solution. What will be the first steps you take? The first steps would be to develop your own solution. Again, this might sound very trivial, since aren't you asking for help because you can't find a solution? Most of the time, this is not the case. Most of the time people ask for help because they don't know where to start, so this forces you to do something. If you can start with a solution, it doesn't matter how bad it might be, it will give the person you are asking the question to a glimpse into your mind. This will make it easier for them to be able to understand your way of thinking. The easier it is for them to understand what you are thinking, the easier it is for them to offer real, productive advice. 

Let's dive a little deeper into this example. What are the kinds of questions you could ask when trying to understand a real-world problem? For example, if I have to create a program that prints "Welcome to my program!" to the screen, I need to know where to start. Let's assume no-one can help me until I have my own suggestion, so I need to come up with an initial idea.

***Initial Steps***

Find out what tools I have available.
I'm using the Python programming language and I have access to the internet. Assuming you can't ask anyone for help, how would you start solving this problem. 

Search for some quick answers.
I search on Google "how to print a sentence on the screen in Python" which gives some useful search results. This whole process might seem a little basic, right? Why would I need to be taking a course which teaches how to search things on Google? That's not exactly what is being taught here, but this is rather an example of the quickest and easiest way to get started. People often think that the process of finding answers is complex and requires in-depth knowledge about the subject. However, the truth is that often you can search simple, easy phrases and manually go through the results. This process can be slow, but it is also effective.

### Finding answers
Inline with the previous section, the goal is to be able to find the correct answers.  Often perceptions of what programming make it out to be more intimidating than it actually is. The truth is that programming is made up of very small snippets of code that all work together. It is therefore important to make your search queries as concise and specific as possible, so that you are able to understand the small code snippets. How does this look in practice? Let's take a look at the following example.

I'm going to ask you how to "print the contents of a list of strings using a for loop". What is the first step that you need to take? Well, it's pretty clear that since we haven't learned anything about programming, the question doesn't even make sense - this is okay. The first step would then be to understand the question i.e. to break it down into smaller pieces. There are some keyword "list of strings" and "for loop". That's where we are going to start, so we can begin by doing a few searches.
"What is a list of strings in Python"
"What is a for loop in Python"
"How to print a list of strings in Python"
"How to print the contents of a list of strings using a for loop in Python" (you can always search for the exact question)
This is a good starting point and we will come back to these searches when we do the advanced exercise at the end of this module. 

**Vetting results**

Now that you are able to find some ways in which to solve the problems, the next step is too see whether those results are the best that you can find. One way to do this is to find at least 3 different sites that provide solutions to the problem, compare them and choose the one with the least amount of steps required. A good rule of thumb is to avoid any unnecessary installations, code that is unreasonably long or code that you don't understand at all. A lot of the time, you will find code that could contain parts which are unfamiliar to you. If you don't understand anything written in the code, then it would be beneficial to break that solution down and figure out how each component of the code works. This will help you to understand if the code is what you were looking for.

**Practical Exercise**

The following is an exercise that is aimed to put into practice what was covered in the above module. It assumes that you know no programming yet and is rather based around what you would do to solve the problem given that you haven't learned how to write any code yet. There will be three "hints" sections which will give you some help, but the idea is that you wouldn't need them if you follow the guidelines in this module. 

Your task is to write a line of code in Python that prints "Welcome to my program!" to the screen. You shouldn't install anything on your computer or create any accounts on websites. 

**Hint 1**

Have you broken down your problem into smaller pieces? 
Have you assessed what tools you have available? 
Have you searched the internet for answers and formed an initial solution?

**Hint 2**

Problem breakdown: 
What I need to do: print something to the screen
Tools I have available: Python and the internet

Search queries based on the above:
"How to print something to the screen using Python"
"How to write a line of code in Python"
"How to write code online"
"How to write code in Python without installing anything"

**Hint 3**

There are websites where you can write code on the website in Python, click run and it will run the code. This will produce the output that you need. Now that you have this information, do you remember which piece of code you wanted to write?

**Solution**

The following website has a built-in compiler (confirmed 18 March 2022, so later dates the website might not) https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/ and it even has the code set as default.
Enter the following code print("Welcome to my program!") into the left box and click the run button. On the right-hand side you will see the results. Congratulations on writing your first piece of code!
