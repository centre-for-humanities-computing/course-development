**Examples**
1. I am an historian and I need to go through 3000 documents to find specific people and list the sentences their names appear in. I can then read through those sentences manually to find which ones are relevant to my research.
	-  Input
	    -  	Find the data i.e. where is it located? Can you access it?
	    -   In which format is the data i.e. text files, pdfs, physical books?
    -   Processing
	    -   Read the files
	    -   Split the files into sentences
	    -   Loop through each sentence and save those which have the name to a list
    - Output
	    - Save those lists to a file which can be read or printed out
  2. Iâ€™m a linguist and I need to extract all the verbs from a document, count them and display the top 10 occurring verbs. I will use these top 10 verbs to determine what the document is about.
		- Input
			-    Find the document i.e. where is located?
			-   Determine what file type the document is.
		- Processing
			-   Read the contents of the document
			-   Separate all the words
			-   Filter out anything that is not a verb
			-   Count the remaining verbs
			-   Sort them from most frequency to least frequent
		- Output
			- Display the top 10 elements of the sorted list
