### Computational Thinking
Being able to think is one of the hallmarks of being a human being - especially meta thinking which involves thinking about your own thoughts. We often overlook the complexity of thinking because it comes so naturally to us. It seems so easy because we do it everyday with little to no thought about how the process works. It only becomes apparent that it is complex when something or someone interrupts our thought process e.g. try explaining a specific idea you have to someone in one or two sentences; or try follow a lecture in a topic you don't know anything about. These tasks become difficult because in our daily life we strip away what we can safely assume to make communication easier and more effective. This stripping away of "unnecessary" information becomes a problem when we need it. This is most prominent when working with computer programming because a computer cannot assume any information, so you have to provide commands without exception. This means that you have to adjust your thinking slightly to work through problems in the same way a computer program would. This isn't as daunting as it sounds because it is quite straightforward and it can also help with the way in which you solve problems outside of programming too. 

The main purpose of computational thinking is to identify problems and solve them. This seems simple, but problems themselves can be quite complex and made up of different parts, each of which forms its own separate problem. The complex nature of problems can make them seem to be overwhelming, but when you follow a few simple steps, you are able to break them down into manageable pieces. This is very effective because not only does it work for computational problems, but it also works for most problems you will face in life. There are four key steps in this process: 1) decomposition, 2) pattern recognition, 3) abstraction and 4) algorithmic thinking. Using these four steps, you will be able to successfully solve problems by "dividing and conquering" them. There are also some additional factors that need to be considered that are not directly related to the core way of solving the problem - constraints. There could be several constraints that you are facing which were unforeseeable, imposed upon your project or factors that weren't considered when starting. In this course, you will learn to use these four steps as well as how to deal with constraints and what you can do to mitigate the effects of them. 

Another point that is important to understand involves the following three words: what, why and how. It is always important to understand what you are doing because if you don't understand that then you cannot reorientate yourself when you face problems in your project. In the same way, you need to understand why you are doing something. Keeping a goal in mind when you break down a problem into smaller pieces will keep you focused on the big picture even when you are working on the smaller issues. This is vital for lose losing sight of what your final goal is. Lastly, having a clear understanding of how you are going to do something will put an element of realism to a project and reveal any potential unrealistic expectations right in the beginning. These are three important components to keep in mind when you are working on any step of the computational thinking process. They are supplementary because even though they help keep you on track, you still need the plan and the action to achieve the goal.

This course will teach you how to effectively use these concepts to become a self-sufficient learner and problem-solver. Not only in the computational world, but also in the real world where you are faced with problems that are much less logical and solutions that are suboptimal at best. The principles behind both real world and computational problems are essentially the same, so these lessons are applicable in most - if not all - domains of study and life. The main point you need to keep in mind is that the purpose of the exercises isn't necessarily to achieve that specific goal, but it's rather to go through the process so that you learn the formula to achieve any goal.
