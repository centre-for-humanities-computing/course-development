# Computational Thinking
Being able to think is one of the hallmarks of being a human being - especially meta thinking which involves thinking about your own thoughts. We often overlook the complexity of thinking because it comes so naturally to us. It seems so easy because we do it everyday with little to no thought about how the process works. It only becomes apparent that it is complex when something or someone interrupts our thought process e.g. try explaining a specific idea you have to someone in one or two sentences; or try follow a lecture in a topic you don't know anything about. These tasks become difficult because in our daily life we strip away what we can safely assume to make communication easier and more effective. This stripping away of "unnecessary" information becomes a problem when we need it. This is most prominent when working with computer programming because a computer cannot assume any information, so you have to provide commands without exception. This means that you have to adjust your thinking slightly to work through problems in the same way a computer program would. This isn't as daunting as it sounds because it is quite straightforward and it can also help with the way in which you solve problems outside of programming too. 

The main purpose of computational thinking is to identify problems and solve them. This seems simple, but problems themselves can be quite complex and made up of different parts, each of which forms its own separate problem. The complex nature of problems can make them seem to be overwhelming, but when you follow a few simple steps, you are able to break them down into manageable pieces. This is very effective because not only does it work for computational problems, but it also works for most problems you will face in life. There are four key steps in this process: 1) decomposition, 2) pattern recognition, 3) abstraction and 4) algorithmic thinking. Using these four steps, you will be able to successfully solve problems by "dividing and conquering" them. There are also some additional factors that need to be considered that are not directly related to the core way of solving the problem - constraints. There could be several constraints that you are facing which were unforeseeable, imposed upon your project or factors that weren't considered when starting. In this course, you will learn to use these four steps as well as how to deal with constraints and what you can do to mitigate the effects of them. 

Another point that is important to understand involves the following three words: what, why and how. It is always important to understand what you are doing because if you don't understand that then you cannot reorientate yourself when you face problems in your project. In the same way, you need to understand why you are doing something. Keeping a goal in mind when you break down a problem into smaller pieces will keep you focused on the big picture even when you are working on the smaller issues. This is vital for lose losing sight of what your final goal is. Lastly, having a clear understanding of how you are going to do something will put an element of realism to a project and reveal any potential unrealistic expectations right in the beginning. These are three important components to keep in mind when you are working on any step of the computational thinking process. They are supplementary because even though they help keep you on track, you still need the plan and the action to achieve the goal.

This course will teach you how to effectively use these concepts to become a self-sufficient learner and problem-solver. Not only in the computational world, but also in the real world where you are faced with problems that are much less logical and solutions that are suboptimal at best. The principles behind both real world and computational problems are essentially the same, so these lessons are applicable in most - if not all - domains of study and life. The main point you need to keep in mind is that the purpose of the exercises isn't necessarily to achieve that specific goal, but it's rather to go through the process so that you learn the formula to achieve any goal. 

# The four components of computational thinking
## Decomposition
In simple terms, decomposition is the process of breaking down a large problem into smaller problems. There are a few reasons why this is helpful in the bigger picture. It gives you insight into the practicalities associated with solving the problem. You can view the smaller tasks with more understanding of what needs to be done because the goal is clearer. This can help you develop actionable steps and get started on solving them. Image for a moment you moved to a new house and there is nothing in it yet, but you want to make a cup of coffee after a day of moving. This seems like a simple enough problem to solve - except that it isn't. You are actually dealing with a complex problem because it's made up of several problems disguised as one, so the problem actually seems to be impossible. You cannot make coffee because you don't have any of the ingredients in your house. So there are two main tasks to solve: buy ingredients and make the coffee. 

There two tasks can be further broken down into even simpler tasks. When you buy ingredients, you need to do three things: 1) make of list of ingredients you need, 2) decide where you are going to buy them, and 3) decide how you are going to get there. 

### Make a list of ingredients you need
This can further be divided into separate tasks for each item that you need to buy. You will need milk, water, coffee powder, a kettle, a spoon and a mug. 

### Decide where you are going to them
You can buy all of those items at the supermarket, so you decide to go there.

### Decide how you are going to get there
The fastest why to the supermarket is by bus, so you decide to take the bus. You also need to make the same trip home after you are done at the supermarket.

## Pattern recognition
When you have broken the problem down into smaller tasks, you can look for patterns. The first step (the list of ingredients) is made up of several smaller steps even though it looks like one step. The full step would actually be as follows:
1) Take the bus to the supermarket
2) Purchase the milk
3) Take the bus back home
4) Repeat the process for all the items

This isn't an efficient way of doing this, so we can look for patterns in the tasks. The glaringly obvious pattern is that if we buy all the items at the supermarket then we only have to make one trip to the supermarket and one trip back home. This is process of pattern recognition is very useful in using previous knowledge to apply to new problems. For example, perhaps you are going to a new supermarket because your regular supermarket is closed for the day. You don't need to go through the entire process of planning everything out because you can use the same pattern as usual, but adjusting a few key points. You would have to take a different bus and walk an extra few meters to get to the new supermarket, but buying the ticket, purchasing the items inside the supermarket and returning home is still the same process. You have recognized a pattern that you can use for other problems which have similar characteristics.
