# Computational Thinking
Being able to think is one of the hallmarks of being a human being - especially meta thinking which involves thinking about your own thoughts. We often overlook the complexity of thinking because it comes so naturally to us. It seems so easy because we do it everyday with little to no thought about how the process works. It only becomes apparent that it is complex when something or someone interrupts our thought process e.g. try explaining a specific idea you have to someone in one or two sentences; or try follow a lecture in a topic you don't know anything about. These tasks become difficult because in our daily life we strip away what we can safely assume to make communication easier and more effective. This stripping away of "unnecessary" information becomes a problem when we need it. This is most prominent when working with computer programming because a computer cannot assume any information, so you have to provide commands without exception. This means that you have to adjust your thinking slightly to work through problems in the same way a computer program would. This isn't as daunting as it sounds because it is quite straightforward and it can also help with the way in which you solve problems outside of programming too. 

The main purpose of computational thinking is to identify problems and solve them. This seems simple, but problems themselves can be quite complex and made up of different parts, each of which forms its own separate problem. The complex nature of problems can make them seem to be overwhelming, but when you follow a few simple steps, you are able to break them down into manageable pieces. This is very effective because not only does it work for computational problems, but it also works for most problems you will face in life. There are four key steps in this process: 1) decomposition, 2) pattern recognition, 3) abstraction and 4) algorithmic thinking. Using these four steps, you will be able to successfully solve problems by "dividing and conquering" them. There are also some additional factors that need to be considered that are not directly related to the core way of solving the problem - constraints. There could be several constraints that you are facing which were unforeseeable, imposed upon your project or factors that weren't considered when starting. In this course, you will learn to use these four steps as well as how to deal with constraints and what you can do to mitigate the effects of them. 

Another point that is important to understand involves the following three words: what, why and how. It is always important to understand what you are doing because if you don't understand that then you cannot reorientate yourself when you face problems in your project. In the same way, you need to understand why you are doing something. Keeping a goal in mind when you break down a problem into smaller pieces will keep you focused on the big picture even when you are working on the smaller issues. This is vital for lose losing sight of what your final goal is. Lastly, having a clear understanding of how you are going to do something will put an element of realism to a project and reveal any potential unrealistic expectations right in the beginning. These are three important components to keep in mind when you are working on any step of the computational thinking process. They are supplementary because even though they help keep you on track, you still need the plan and the action to achieve the goal.

This course will teach you how to effectively use these concepts to become a self-sufficient learner and problem-solver. Not only in the computational world, but also in the real world where you are faced with problems that are much less logical and solutions that are suboptimal at best. The principles behind both real world and computational problems are essentially the same, so these lessons are applicable in most - if not all - domains of study and life. The main point you need to keep in mind is that the purpose of the exercises isn't necessarily to achieve that specific goal, but it's rather to go through the process so that you learn the formula to achieve any goal. 

# The four components of computational thinking
## Decomposition
In simple terms, decomposition is the process of breaking down a large problem into smaller problems. There are a few reasons why this is helpful in the bigger picture. It gives you insight into the practicalities associated with solving the problem. You can view the smaller tasks with more understanding of what needs to be done because the goal is clearer. This can help you develop actionable steps and get started on solving them. Image for a moment you moved to a new house and there is nothing in it yet, but you want to make a cup of coffee after a day of moving. This seems like a simple enough problem to solve - except that it isn't. You are actually dealing with a complex problem because it's made up of several problems disguised as one, so the problem actually seems to be impossible. You cannot make coffee because you don't have any of the ingredients in your house. So there are two main tasks to solve: buy ingredients and make the coffee. 

There two tasks can be further broken down into even simpler tasks. When you buy ingredients, you need to do three things: 1) make of list of ingredients you need, 2) decide where you are going to buy them, and 3) decide how you are going to get there. 

### Make a list of ingredients you need
This can further be divided into separate tasks for each item that you need to buy. You will need milk, water, coffee powder, a kettle, a spoon and a mug. 

### Decide where you are going to them
You can buy all of those items at the supermarket, so you decide to go there.

### Decide how you are going to get there
The fastest why to the supermarket is by bus, so you decide to take the bus. You also need to make the same trip home after you are done at the supermarket.

## Pattern recognition
When you have broken the problem down into smaller tasks, you can look for patterns. The first step (the list of ingredients) is made up of several smaller steps even though it looks like one step. The full step would actually be as follows:
1) Take the bus to the supermarket
2) Purchase the milk
3) Take the bus back home
4) Repeat the process for all the items

This isn't an efficient way of doing this, so we can look for patterns in the tasks. The glaringly obvious pattern is that if we buy all the items at the supermarket then we only have to make one trip to the supermarket and one trip back home. This is process of pattern recognition is very useful in using previous knowledge to apply to new problems. For example, perhaps you are going to a new supermarket because your regular supermarket is closed for the day. You don't need to go through the entire process of planning everything out because you can use the same pattern as usual, but adjusting a few key points. You would have to take a different bus and walk an extra few meters to get to the new supermarket, but buying the ticket, purchasing the items inside the supermarket and returning home is still the same process. You have recognized a pattern that you can use for other problems which have similar characteristics. 

## Abstraction
The process of abstraction is to discard unnecessary details that are not relevant to solving the problem. You shouldn't, in face you cannot, take everything into account when making a decision, so you filter out any unnecessary details and focus on what is relevant to the problem you are solving. In the above example, you take the bus to get to the supermarket. Is it important that you know every stop on the way to the bus stop? No. Is it important that you know the model of the bus you are taking? No. Is it important that you know the bus drivers name? No. These are all factors that could be relevant to someone else if they have task that involves those details. For example, if you are a bus driver and you need to change shifts with a bus driver named John then it's important to know the name of the bus driver. So, it's not necessarily the case that the details are not important, but rather that there are details that are not important to your own task.

## Algorithmic thinking
When you have decomposed the problem, identified any patterns and filtered out the unnecessary details, you are ready to create a step-by-step guide on how to solve the actual problems. At this point you need to make detailed plans for each step. You have to specify actions in the right order and with sufficient detail, so you can't just say "take the bus to the supermarket and come back when you're done". You need to specify the smaller details such as the time you need to catch the bus, where you need to catch the bus and which number bus you need to catch. Then you need to specify where to get off, which direction to take towards the supermarket and how to long walk from the bus stop. Once you're in the supermarket, you need to find all the items, collect them in a basket and pay for them. Then you repeat the bus process in reverse order making sure to take the bus from the opposite side of the street. 

## The relevance of the four steps
The importance of the four steps is to focus your thinking on the details of the problem, remove any inferences you might have and realistically show what kind of problem you are dealing with. This may seem a bit strange with the coffee example, but what is important isn't the example itself, but rather the way in which it was broken down and solved. This forms a blueprint for solving problems and you can use this blueprint to solve other problems. After doing a simple example, you can scale up the complexity of the problems until you are able to this for any problem you face. However, there are other factors to take into account because after all, the world we live in isn't a static place, so things often change. 

## Constraints
There are often things that change along the way, so it's important to understand that most of the time you will have to work within some constraints because you hardly ever have the ideal conditions for carrying out your plan. For example if the supermarket doesn't have any coffee in stock then what is the solution for that? You could buy tea instead or buy some takeout coffee from the restaurant next door. These aren't optimal solutions, but they are alternatives to the constraints that you may face in the real world. What if you find out that the buses have changed their payment systems and now you need to pay with a transit card. The only problem is that you've never used a transit card before, so you need to figure out how it works. In this case, the decomposition of your plan is still valid, but you need to adjust the algorithmic thinking portion of the four steps. You would need to prioritize getting a bus transit card and loading it with money before going to the bus stop. This would form a new tasks which takes a higher priority to the other tasks since you cannot complete any of the other tasks without first getting the bus transit card.

# What is a real world problem?
One of the biggest problems that most people face when they are trying to progress in towards a goal is finding problems to solve. Working through a textbook or a course where there are problems laid out for you. Having the problem presented in such a way removes a great deal of the thought required because in the real world, problems aren't generally so simple to find. For example, when you are getting your education everything is laid out for you in the form of a curriculum. You have a certain amount of courses that you have to pass and the grade which you need is also decided by the administration. There is not thinking involved in deciding for yourself what is an acceptable grade to get to pass the subject, but rather you just have to focus on learning the material in the class and pad the tests. This eliminates a lot of the thought processes that you need and makes questions such as "why" unnecessary. If you asked why do you need a certain grade to pass, then the answer will most likely be that it's set by the education ministry. A situation like this is similar to a "sandbox" in the development world. This is used to refer to an environment that isn't real, but functions like a real environment in which there are certain constraints on what can be done. 

There are very logical reasons why education is structured like this, so this is in no means a disparagement on the educational system. However, what tends to happen is that when you need to make decisions where the problem isn't laid out clearly then it's difficult to know where to start. Which is exactly what is expected if you haven't been trained in it. For example, if we look at education versus the job market, there is a stark difference in how the two need to be approached. When you have finished your education - whether it's high school or university - you need to find a job. There is not formula to find a job that is comparable to the formula used to get people educated. You can pass a certain number of courses after which you get a degree at university for example, but you cannot go the a certain amount of job workshops then automatically get a job. The job market doesn't work like that. Instead what it does is show you how the market works in the real world. From that you have to do some investigative work to find out where you can get an opportunity. This is an important difference between the job market and educational system because you have to decide where you start and what "grade" is acceptable. 

It is, therefore, important to learn to prioritize what is the most urgent problem and solve that first. In the job market example, your first priority is to get a job because you either get a job or you are jobless. The first option is good and the second option is bad. Contrast that to deciding between two jobs that you could get. In that case, both options are good, so while there is still a choice that needs to be made, it's different from choosing between being jobless and having a job. The same applies to other decisions in life and especially the decisions in programming.

# Decisions in programming
Up until now, we haven't discussed anything directly related to writing designing a program. This has been intentional because the exercise in this section is going to address that. Programming is actually better described as problem solving and using the four steps of computational thinking is a guide on how to do that. So, you actually have been learning to program - although you need to learn the practicalities of it now. Programming languages are simply ways in which you can communicate the plan you have designed to a computer. The computer then does the work and what appears on the screen are the results. This could be what you expected or it could be unexpected. Base on what appears on the screen, you can continue with your plan or adjust mistakes. You repeat this process until the main problem is solved. We are going to learning to program in Python, but the programming language is largely irrelevant because writing code is similar to writing a book. There are two components that are important to writing a book: the structure and the language. The structure is the way in which the book's narrative flows and the language is the what words that are written on the pages. In the same way, computational thinking is the structure of the program (the logical flow) and the programming language (the characters on the screen) are what brings that structure to life. They are both necessary and there can be errors in both, so it's important to understand how they work together.

## The exercise
The first exercise you are going to actually program without knowing how to program. Sounds impossible, right? Well, it's possible if you understood the previous lessons. Just like in the real world, the task is not going to be laid out perfectly, but rather you have to decide what is the best way to do it. In programming languages, it's customary for the first program to print the words "Hello world!", so to keep with custom, that is your tasks. You can do this however you want, but the following are a few tips
1) Think about Occam's Razor (the simplest solution is usually the optimal one)
2) Don't ask anyone for help - if you get frustrated then take a break and walk around. The point is for you to solve the problem, not someone else. 
3) If you have tried absolutely everything and you can't figure out the answer, then tell me you can't figure it out, but you have to include what you have tried.
